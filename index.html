						Video game characters, historically, have been largely male. Female characters in video games, as a result, have long been relegated to support roles and “set-dressing”, leading to the creation of multiple negative archetypes that many characters past and present can be assigned to.
					</p>
					<p>
						As you navigate this page, you will find definitions of these archetypes, which aims to expose the issues each present.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end, you will find a proposed update to the Bechdel Test, which aims to capture the simplicity of the original test, while allowing for appropriate application to the fluidity of gaming as a medium. This test is designed in a way that one can gauge how well female characters are represented in a given game, while keeping the archetypes in mind.
